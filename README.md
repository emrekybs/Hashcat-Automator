# HASHCAT-AUTOMATOR

The python script I created to speed up my processes
I combined the hash attacks that I use most often in a single python script.
In this script I also added the Hashid and Hash-identifier tools.

## Requirements
```bash
$ apt-get install hashcat && apt-get install hashid && apt-get install hash-identifier
```

# Distributions

Debian and Arch based distributions are supported. (YOU need kali or blackarch repo in your package manager)

# Enjoy Hash
